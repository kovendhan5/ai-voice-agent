## 🎤 **How Voice Conversations Work**

### **User Experience:**
1. 🎤 **Click microphone** → Start talking naturally
2. 🧠 **AI processes** your speech and understands context
3. 🤖 **AI generates** intelligent response based on conversation
4. 🎵 **Orpheus TTS** converts AI response to realistic speech
5. 🔊 **You hear** the AI talking back to you
6. 💬 **Continue** the natural conversation

### **Example Conversation:**
```
You: "Hello, how are you today?"
AI: "I'm doing great, thank you! I'm excited to be talking with you. How are you doing today?"

You: "Tell me about artificial intelligence"
AI: "AI is fascinating! It's technology that can understand, learn, and respond like humans. What specifically about AI interests you?"

You: "What can you help me with?"
AI: "I can have conversations, answer questions, discuss topics, and even tell jokes! What would you like to explore?"
```

def get_response(self, user_input):
    response = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

### **Add Real Orpheus Model:**
When available, replace `orpheus_tts.py` with:
```python
from orpheus_speech import OrpheusModel  # Real package
```
